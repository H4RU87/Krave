</br>
<p>Hello,
</br>My name is Haesol Lee and I am a full-stack web developer who is used to dealing with hundreds of lines of code every now and then.
</br>I am currently enrolled in General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive program and seeking employment starting in Summer 2016.
</br>
Before my current life, I used to be in automotive industry doing Part Development & Purchasing work. During this time, </br>
I was professionally involved in the scene of “development”, not just for my clients or company but also for myself.
</br>Eventually my passion in technology has led me where I am today as a web developer.
</br>
My focus and core competencies are </br>
• Proficient in HTML, CSS3, Javascript </br>
• Front End projects using Javascript/CSS frameworks</br>
• Back end projects using ruby on rails</br>
• Long/short term project management and strategic planning skills,</br>
• Efficient, passionate, objective-driven, and open-minded leader, combined with strong problem solving and critical thinking skills.

   <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenanfranklin">Hire Kenan</a>

   </br>Reasons I'd be an amazing addition to your team:
</br>6. Logic is everything to me. If I have a problem before me I'll do my best to work it out.
</br>5. I'm resourceful and I'm not afraid to "teach" myself how to do something. I'm a dreamer, and I have a lot of ideas. So I figure, where there is a will, there is a way.
</br>4. I walk up to people and form conversation, some times it's unwarranted.
</br>3. I’m not afraid of hard work. Life is a complex puzzle.
</br>2. I randomly sing songs... some real... some made up.
</br>1. I'm creative and I enjoy the outlet I get from making my ideas a reality.
